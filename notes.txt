more work needs to be done on understanding hoisting and how async works for the most part

I failed quite a bit with the data fetch and attempting to have and access the information outside of the fetch
to my understanding everything else around the fetch loads much faster than the fetch so if i want to work with
the information i get from the fetch i have to use functions outside of (for readability mostly) and use them
within the fetch.

Having some trouble with css but that will be what I focus on last for the most part.

need to look into type more, switched type='text/javascript' in the <script> tag of the html file to 
type='module' for import functionality.
